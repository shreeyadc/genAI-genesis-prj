## **Echomind**

EchoMind is an AI-powered emotion-aware voice journaling and generative art therapy tool. Users speak about their feelings, and the system analyzes their emotions using NLP, transforms their words into visual artwork, and provides AI-powered affirmations or creative outlets like poems, music, or personalized meditative visuals. It also generates AI music based on the user's journal entry.
Inspiration
We were inspired by the Pixar movie Inside Out! Emotional well-being is essential, yet millions struggle to articulate their feelings, especially those with Alexithymia. While journaling is a proven method for self-reflection, not everyone finds it easy to put emotions into words. Traditional therapy is not always accessible due to cost, stigma, or availability. We envisioned EchoMind as a transformative toolâ€”one that makes emotional expression effortless, mental health support more inclusive, and healing a deeply personal, creative experience.
